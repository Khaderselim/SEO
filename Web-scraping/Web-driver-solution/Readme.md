# SEO Web Scraping with Web Driver Solution

This project contains a web scraping solution using a web driver. The project uses Docker to containerize the application for easy setup and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command:

```sh
docker build -t playwright-app .
```

This command builds the Docker image and tags it as `playwright-app`.

## Running the Docker Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run the container using the following command:

```sh
docker run -it playwright-app
```

This command runs the Docker container and starts the application.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that you are in the correct directory where the `Dockerfile` is located before running the above commands.
- If you encounter any issues, make sure Docker is running on your machine and that you have sufficient permissions to run Docker commands.
