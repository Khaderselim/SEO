This project contains a web scraping solution using a web driver. The project uses Docker Compose to containerize the application for easy setup and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- Docker Compose: Make sure you have Docker Compose installed. You can download Docker Compose from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Using Docker Compose

To build and run the application using Docker Compose, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds the Docker image and starts the application using Docker Compose.
